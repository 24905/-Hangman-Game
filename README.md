A simple command-line Hangman game written in Python. The game allows players to guess letters of hidden words until they either complete the word or run out of attempts.

📌 Features

Predefined list of words (python, hangman, random, string, loops).

Player gets 6 attempts for each word.

Shows used letters to avoid repeating guesses.

Displays the current progress of the word (_ for unguessed letters).

Supports multiple rounds (plays through all words in the list).

No external libraries are required.

🚀 How to Run

Clone or download this repository.

🎯 How to Play

Enter one letter at a time.

If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed.
